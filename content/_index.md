## Daneshvar Amrollahi


I am a first-year **Computer Science PhD student** at **Stanford University**, fortunate to be advised by **Prof. Clark Barrett** and working on the state-of-the-art SMT Solver, [cvc5](https://cvc5.github.io/).
 
Before my time at Stanford, I engaged in research internships at TU Wien, EPFL and ETH Zurich.
At TU Wien, with Prof. Laura Kovács and Prof. Ezio Bartocci, I extended previous techniques in polynomial loop invariant generation to handle a broader set of loops labeled as _Unsolvable_. I implemented the theory in the probabilistic loop analyzer [POLAR](https://github.com/probing-lab/polar) and the work was recognized with the [**Radhia Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award**](https://staticanalysis.org/#award) at SAS 2022. 
Also, we introduced a framework for synthesizing recursive programs, using induction on algebraic data types. I implemented our theory in the [Vampire](https://github.com/vprover/vampire/tree/synthesis-recursive) automated theorem prover. This work is currently under review at a top-tier venue.
At EPFL, with Prof. George Candea, I developed an interest in systems research (computer networks, operating systems, distributed systems). I integrated Z3's support for quantifiers in first-order logic into the KLEE symbolic execution engine codebase. This enhancement boosted the scalability of a network verification approach using symbolic execution by mitigating the path explosion problem due to loops. At ETH Zurich, I worked on verifying initialization code in Golang by viewing it as a concurrency problem.
