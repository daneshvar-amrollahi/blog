## Daneshvar Amrollahi


I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University. Currently, I am fortunate to be rotating with Prof. Clark Barrett and working on the state-of-the-art SMT Solver, [cvc5](https://cvc5.github.io/).

Prior to joining Stanford, I did research internships at TU Wien and EPFL. 

At TU Wien, I mainly focused on two projects:

1. **Algebraic Loop Reasoning**: I extended previous techniques in **polynomial loop invariant generation** to handle a broader set of loops labeled as _Unsolvable_ involving circular non-linear dependencies in loop variables. I implemented the theory in the probabilistic loop analyzer [POLAR](https://github.com/probing-lab/polar) and the work was recognized with the **Radhia Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award** at SAS 2022. 

2. **Recursive Program Synthesis**: We introduced a framework for synthesizing recursive programs based on a first-order logic formula serving as the program specification. This approach combines mathematical induction and saturation-based **theorem proving**. I implemented our theory in the [Vampire](https://github.com/vprover/vampire/tree/synthesis-recursive) theorem prover. This work is currently under review at a top-tier venue.

At EPFL, I developed an interest in verifying computer systems (computer networks, operating systems, distributed systems). I integrated **Z3**'s support for quantifiers in first-order logic into the **KLEE** symbolic execution engine codebase. This enhancement boosted the scalability of a **network verification** approach using **symbolic execution** by addressing the path explosion problem.
